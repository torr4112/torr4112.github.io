                    This past summer, I worked as a Technology Development Program intern at 
                    <a href="https://www.optum.com/" target="_blank">Optum</a>. I was
                    embedded in the Compliance Services team and worked directly with 2 other interns and 1 full-time
                    developer to make a Compliance Portal.

                    The Compliance Portal is a self-service application that allowed Server Admins to monitor
                    all their servers to check their compliance level. Users could see their compliance level 
                    for the several thousand servers they maintained or could drill down to the exact policies
                    they were failing (ie: root default credentials) and make adjustments. This project took
                    10 weeks and will save the Enterprise Hosting Services organization six figures year over
                    year.

                    This past spring in CISC 410 (Advanced Information Security), we made a version of a theorized coin from a

                    which Dr. Yilek named Tommie Coin.

                <p>
                    The coin was a centralized coin, meaning that just 1 person had total control over the coin.
                    However, the ledger was public and theoretically anybody could access it (since we were using
                    local host only we could access). The coin allowed for transactions between users and also let
                    users mine Tommie Coins. We had to implement all proper security measures like signing transactions
                    so that forgery would not be possible. We wrote this all in Python.

                    This past spring in CISC 440 (Artificial Intelligence and Robotics), we implemented solvers to play simple
                    games in the console. One game was isolation, which was basically snake (you have to make
                    the longest chain without moving over yourself).

            </div>
            <div class="grid-x">
                <p class="cell small-12">
                    The game worked by having 2 crucuial methods:
                    <code>findMaxMove</code> and <code>findMinMove</code>
                    which were mutually recursive methods. Basically, when the solver would try to find the 
                    max move, it would also calculate the reaction of the other player and the best move
                    would be the one that maximizes its score and minimizes the opponent's score. For the
                    project, we had to implement both a simple version of this and also one that would 
                    "prune" the decision tree and not waste time calculating moves which could not happen
                    if both players played optimally. This usually led to improved performance, which can be
                    seen below (left is regular, right is pruned).
